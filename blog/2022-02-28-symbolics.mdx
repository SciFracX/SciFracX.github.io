It is very happy to share that FractionalCalculus.jl is now [supporting symbolic fractional differentiation and integration](http://scifracx.org/FractionalCalculus.jl/dev/Derivative/symderivative/)!!!

<!--truncate-->

With the help of [SymbolicUtils.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/SymbolicUtils.jl), it is easy to first declare rules and apply defined rules to the expression

```julia
julia> using FractionalCalculus, SymbolicUtils
julia> @syms x
```

All we need to use are ```semidiff``` and ```semiint``` functions to compute fractional differentiation and integration.

```julia
julia> semidiff(log(x))
log(4x) / sqrt(Ï€x)
```

```julia
julia> semiint(x^2)
0.6018022224509401(x^2.5)
```

Bingo!! Enjoy yourself~
