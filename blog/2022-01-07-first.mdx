Hello all!

The official website of SciFracX project is now published using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)!

SciFracX is an orgnization aiming at making fractional order computing and modeling easier than ever with Julia.

Now, there are four packages under SciFracX, [FractionalSystems.jl](https://github.com/SciFracX/FractionalSystems.jl), [FractionalDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciFracX/FractionalDiffEq.jl), [FractionalCalculus.jl](https://github.com/SciFracX/FractionalCalculus.jl) and [FractionalTransforms.jl](https://github.com/SciFracX/FractionalTransforms.jl).

If you are also interested in fractional order computing and modeling, JuliaLang and numerical methods binding math and programming, welcome to join SciFracX!!!!!
